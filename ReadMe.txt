We have created a database of different categories, subcategories and products. Each category have different subcategories and each subcategory have different products stored in respective vector.
Database have various functions for inserting, deleting, searching and modifying products in the store.
Only administrator has access to these functions.
Every time program is executed a new customer is created when loggeed in as a customer who can add products to its cart and can check out the cart if he has suffecient amount of funds.
As program is terminated total revenue generated is displayed.

Initial state of database is taken from a text file and all products are read from the file and stored in the database.
Customers have to register themselves before login giving an unique username and password then only he is able to buy products.
Customers data is also stored in another file from which user data is read and stored to database along with its cart each time program is executed.
In this way data need not to be initialised each time the program is executed.
